# Breakout Board

The intention of the breakout board is to study and analyze the CD-ROM drive communication protocols used between CD-ROM drive and FMT computer.

Most Desktop drives used a 64 Pin ASIC or custom microcontroller. This in all essence is a black box with no real pinout easily identifiable.

It is expected there should be i2s pins for CDDA, pins for subchannel data from the CD-ROM and then pins for data transfer likely a form of SPI.

# If you are interested grab the gerber files and send to the factory.  There is already a zipped copy ready to use for a factory.
