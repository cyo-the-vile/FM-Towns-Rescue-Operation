EA Drive is unique due to the PCB having two seperate primary LSI on the board.  This makes identifying specific pins easier compared to the 'black box' compared to other drive types.

The two primary semiconductors communication to the CD-Block inside the computer are the MB89615 Microcontroller which is suspected of transmitting the Files to the computer.

The other semiconductor is the MN6621 in a QFP package.  This digital signal processor is responsible for sending i2s audio / CDDA and also subchannel CD data to the CD-Block.
