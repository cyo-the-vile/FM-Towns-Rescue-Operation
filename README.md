# FM-Towns-Rescue-Operation
Study and Analysis of the Proprietary FM Towns Desktop CD-ROM drives.


This repository is a running analysis of the proprietary CD-ROM drive in Fujitsu's legendary computer the FM Towns. The intent is to study the embedded protocols in the CD-ROM drive with the long term intent to make an optical drive emulator. Over 97% of the software for the FM Towns computer is based on CD-ROM and with no new lasers around or with lasers being embedded in very expensive and old Technics CD-ROM players it isn't sustainable to cannibalize the laser from a player.
